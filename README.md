# PINNs-Physics-informed-neural-networks

This repository contains the report and the corresponding codes of my research internship at Friedrich-Alexander-Universit√§t Research Center for Mathematics of Data in Erlangen, Germany. The main goal of this work was the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve various forward and inverse problems in PDEs, where I take the well-understood 1 dimensional wave equation as an example for numerical experiment and error analysis. The codes are organized as follows: 

This is an inline equation: \$E=mc^2\$
